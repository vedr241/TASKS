In Task1, 
Two prime number from the prime number list and target is converted into binary numbers. Using QFT, arithemtic additions are done of two number. Equality of two number are checked using oracle which compared two number with target bitwise.


In Task2, 
Two's Complement are used to convert the negative numbers into binary number without sign.
qram is used to encoded the list of integers with indices. ORacle is used to mark state. DIffuser is used to amplify the indices containing the marked state.

Note: Qbits for converting number to binary is chosen correctly for different sets of inputs.
